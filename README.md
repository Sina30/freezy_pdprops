A simple script for pd supported by ox_lib. The script offers 3 objects: 1) cone 2) spike strip 3) barrier. The object can also be picked up using ox_target/qtarget, where a progress bar is displayed. There is also a configurable object placement delay to prevent object spamming. The menu can be accessed by either the /pdprops command or the f5 key.
